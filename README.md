# Brainfart, the worst programming language you will never use, based on *Brainfuck*.
:)
It's pretty much an expansion of *Brainfuck*
# Why?
The reason I made this was because it looked fun and I fell in love with the mind-bending nature of trying to write code in the *Brainfuck* eso-lang, and had tons of fun trying to write mini-programs and thinking algorithmically.

So I started writing a simple NodeJS "runtime" for it, to be honest it did not take that long to write one with it's simple 8 operation instruction set. But I wanted to extend it and I thought that the best thing to do would be to add "registers". These would be able to be accessed like variables throughout the entire memory space, and would allow for a much faster & easier writing. As well as making space easier to handle.
# What?
Its a cool programming language. :)
It's also very "fun" to write in. :(
# When?
In 2022-something.
# Where?
Somewhere in sunny California.
# How?
Magic.
